## Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to scrape key details of the AstroPedia website and show them in a new website using Flask.

More specifically, I use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
